	HOW TO ACTIVATE POSTPROCESSING IN THE CAMERA
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. Download a Post Processing asset in the Package Manager

2. Create a new layer called PostProcessing.

3. In the main camera add a new component called Post Processing Layer, in Trigger select the main camera and select the layer that you have created (Post Processing Layer).

4. Create a new empty object in the Hierarchy (I will call it PP Volume).

5. Inside it add a new component called Post Processing Volume, activate "is global" and click on profile-> new.

6. Click on add effect and add "Ambient Occlusion" and "Bloom". Within AO activate "Intensity" at 1 and within "Bloom", activate Soft Knee, Clamp, Difussion and Intensity at 5.


PS: If it doesn't work on the asset when you export it, delete everything and start again at step 1.
